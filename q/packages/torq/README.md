# `TorQ`

The TorQ framework created by AquaQ Analytics forms the basis of a production kdb+ system by
implementing some core functionality and utilities on top of kdb+, allowing developers to
concentrate on the application business logic. It incorporates as many best practices as possible,
with particular focus on performance, process management, diagnostic information, maintainability
and extensibility. Wherever possible, we have tried to avoid re-inventing the wheel and instead have
used contributed code from code.kx.com (either directly or modified). This framework will be
suitable for those looking to create a new kdb+ system from scratch or those looking to add
additional functionality to their existing kdb+ systems.
